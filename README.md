# password_manager
#Password manager was orignially developed for the purpose of holding my own
 passwords securely-ish, at least not in readable english, but I've run into 
 probelms with methods of encryption and decrypting that encryption with any 
 user generated password which is an integer
#This first version works by adding the user defined integer password to
 every single characters ascii value in that users password file
